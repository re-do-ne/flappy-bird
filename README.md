# Flappy Bird

Having a go at a simple Flappy Bird implementation using python and the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library.

This will serve as the base for a [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)
implementation as part of an ongoing study into Machine Learning.

WIP.
